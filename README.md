# Advanced-Motorized-Curtain-Control-with-UART-Limit-Switch-Debouncing-AVR-
This AVR-based embedded system automates the opening and closing of a curtain using UART serial commands and physical **limit switches**. The system implements **debounce logic** to avoid false triggers from mechanical bounce and maintains **state awareness** to prevent redundant motor operations.
